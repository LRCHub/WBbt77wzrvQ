You say the hill's too steep to climb
Trying
You say you'd like to see me try
Climbing
You pick the place and I'll choose the time
And I'll climb the hill in my own way
Just wait a while for the right day
And as I rise above the treelines and the clouds
I look down hearing the sounds of the things you've said today

Fearlessly the idiot faced the crowd
Smiling
Mercyless the magistrate turns round
Frowning
And who's the fool who wears the crown
Go down in your own way
And every day is the right day
And as you rise above the fearlines in his crown
You look down hearing the sound of the faces in the crowd
