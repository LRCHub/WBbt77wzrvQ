I don't care what you need
I only do it to please me
There's no one who sees it from my point-of-view

You're pulling me left to right
I had it up to here
It's making me sick to see you alive

Enough of conspiracy
'Cause you cannot win
Like a bomb I release my anger
I'll be peeling your skin

I'm gonna walk my way
You won't be holding me back
I'm not afraid of you
So just get out of my way
I'll destroy your life
'Cause you are pulling me down
You've reached the end of the rope
So just get out of my way

So just get out of my way

Fear my agony
I'll turn your lies into dust
And everything you've become

Just crawl back where you came from
And disappear from here
Your life is taking a turn for the worse

Enough of conspiracy
'Cause you cannot win
Like a bomb I release my anger
I'll be peeling your skin
Like a bomb I release my anger
I'll be peeling your skin

I'm gonna walk my way
You won't be holding me back
I'm not afraid of you
So just get out of my way
I'll destroy your life
'Cause you are pulling me down
You've reached the end of the rope
So just get out of my way

I'm gonna walk my way
You won't be holding me back
I'm not afraid of you
So just get out of my way
I'll destroy your life
'Cause you are pulling me down
You've reached the end of the rope
So just get out of my way

I know your kind
I've tasted before
You're spitting out all of your lies
I'll push you up against the wall

I'm gonna walk my way
You won't be holding me back
I'm not afraid of you
So just get out of my way
I'll destroy your life
'Cause you are pulling me down
You've reached the end of the rope
So just get out of my way

I'm gonna walk my way
You won't be holding me back
I'm not afraid of you
So just get out of my way
I'll destroy your life
'Cause you are pulling me down
You've reached the end of the rope
So just get out of my way

So just get out of my way
So just get out of my way
So just get out of my way
