[00:20.02] There's something about the way
[00:22.62] The street looks when it's just rained
[00:25.88] There's a glow off the pavement
[00:28.39] You walk me to the car
[00:30.70] And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
[00:35.40] In the middle of the parking lot, yeah
[00:54.40] 
[00:49.56] We're drivin' down the road, I wonder if you know
[00:54.23] I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
[00:59.26] But you're just so cool, run your hands through your hair
[01:04.02] Absentmindedly makin' me want you
[01:20.52] 
[01:08.85] And I don't know how it gets better than this
[01:13.55] You take my hand and drag me headfirst, fearless
[01:18.49] And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
[01:23.37] In a storm in my best dress, fearless
[01:41.87] 
[01:37.26] So baby drive slow 'til we run out of road
[01:42.67] In this one-horse town, I wanna stay right here
[01:47.46] In this passenger seat, you put your eyes on me
[01:52.22] In this moment, now capture it, remember it
[02:13.72] 
[01:56.51] 'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
[02:01.25] You take my hand and drag me headfirst, fearless
[02:06.54] And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
[02:11.68] In a storm in my best dress, fearless
[02:30.18] 
[02:35.05] Well, you stood there with me in the doorway
[02:39.09] My hands shake, I'm not usually this way
[02:43.52] But you pull me in and I'm a little more brave
[02:48.28] It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really somethin'
[02:54.63] It's fearless
[03:00.38] Oh yeah
[03:03.88] 
[03:06.15] 'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
[03:11.43] You take my hand and drag me headfirst, fearless
[03:15.87] And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
[03:21.57] In a storm in my best dress, fearless
[03:40.07] 
[03:25.55] 'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
[03:30.06] You take my hand and drag me headfirst, fearless
[03:35.16] And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
[03:40.35] In a storm in my best dress, fearless
[03:45.26] Oh, oh, oh yeah
